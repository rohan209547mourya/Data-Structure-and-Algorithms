Q1/- What is the Difference between the Statement and the PreparedStatement?
---> Statement 
	1. Statement is a string-based SQL query.
	2. it is not safe as the preparedStatement is.
	3. We need to write the query and it perimeters also and it makes it tough to utilize.
	4. SQL injection is very easy for hacker when we use Statement
	
---> Prepared statement
	1. it is string and perimeters based sql query.
	2. easy to write.
	3. safe from SQL injection.
